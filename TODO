General:
  ☐ Make select an atomic, reusable component.
  ☐ Simplify logic in api wrote for songs ([id] vs index)
  ☐ Prev/next nav doesn't respect list ordering @high 
    ☐ this could be quite complicated!
    ☐ Maybe set the songs list with react context? Or just set it on parent component?
  ✔ Add basic sorting (by title, artist) @done(20-06-15 19:24)

Enhancements:
  ☐ Zustand for state?

UI:
  ☐ Add global player component
  ☐ Figure out demarcation between global player and per song playback options
  ☐ Add album artwork

  Song features:
    ☐ Share
    ☐ Streaming services
    ☐ Play Next
    ☐ Play Later

CSS:
  ✔ Figure out vendor prefixes / if they are necessary? @done(20-06-16 15:24)
  ✔ Media queries? @done(20-06-15 17:39)
  ✔ boxshadow on select looks bad in chrome @done(20-06-15 17:39)
  ☐ Set defaults in global stylesheet
  ☐ Refactor css wrappers + width setting (it's inconsistenly applied between components / parents ATM)

Next.js:
  ☐ Figure out when I have to build vs just deploying?
  ✔ figure out 404 errors https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55887316/next-js-404-error-for-all-preloaded-links @done(20-06-15 17:39)
    ✔ Copied this style: https://github.com/zeit/next-learn-demo/blob/master/4-clean-urls/pages/post.js @done(20-06-15 17:39)
    ✔ Ahh, i think that fixed it. Still get a preload warning, but nothing major. @done(20-06-15 17:39)
    ✔ and we can conditionally render the songs list in index.js. @done(20-06-15 17:39)
    ✔ Had to handle direct visits with [id].js, but seems to be working @done(20-06-15 17:39)
  ☐ figure out case sensitivity and routing (maybe using now.json?)
    - Might be fixed?
